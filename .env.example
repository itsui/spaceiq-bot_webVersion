# Headless Mode
# Set to "true" for background mode (no visible browser)

# Booking Configuration
# Only attempt to book today's date if current time is before this cutoff
# Format: 24-hour time (hour and minute)
# After this time, the bot assumes you don't need a desk for today
# Example: 9:30 AM cutoff means bot won't try to book today after 9:30 AM

# Logging Configuration
# ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOGGING: Captures all UI output to console_*.log files
# With ANSI stripping enabled, files are ~80% smaller (10-50MB instead of 100MB-2GB)
# Set to "false" to save disk space (booking_*.log still has all important info)
ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOGGING=true

# STRIP_ANSI_FROM_LOGS: Remove color codes from console logs (reduces file size by ~80%)
# Highly recommended to keep this enabled if ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOGGING=true
