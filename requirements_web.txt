# Web Interface Requirements for SpaceIQ Bot
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_web.txt

# Flask web framework
Flask==2.3.3

# Additional dependencies (likely already installed for the bot)
# Playwright (for bot functionality)
# python-dotenv (for environment variables)
# asyncio (for async operations)

# Note: The web interface uses Bootstrap and other frontend libraries via CDN,
# so no additional frontend dependencies need to be installed via pip.
